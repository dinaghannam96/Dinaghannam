***This time we will be talking about the concept of growth mindset, we willl know what is it, the opposite of it and the difference between those opposites. so, a growth mindset is that kind of mentality
that is open and flexible for new ideas, activities and most important is welcoming and enjoying learning new issues. having a growing mindset allows you to improve your skills and abilities. But as there is a growth mindset there is a fixed mindset and the comparison here shall appear. So if we start describing the fixed mindset we will find it tend to think in a negative way, running away from any challenge, easily get distracted by any obstacle, avoid the hard work, prefers not to hear criticism and does not accept other's success. So it won't be able to achieve full potentials. But for the growth mindset it is totally the opposite. for me i choose to have a growth mindset, what about you? 😆
And now I will put three reminders for myself to maintain a growth mindset🙃, 
* firstly, where there is hope there is life.
* Secondly, positive mentality leads to great success and productivity😇
and
* finally, I should embrace all negative events and people by not get affected by their negativity and spread posivity***.
😃
