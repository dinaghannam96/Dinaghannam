Key Differences between JSP & HTML :

HTML is a client side scripting language while JSP is a server side programming technology.
HTML is fast as it runs on client (browser) while JSP is slower to load as it runs on server (Apache tomcat, glassfish)
HTML is simple to code, JSP needs some knowledge of Java programming to use it to full extent.
HTML needs cascading style sheets (CSS) and javaScript (JS) to make it look interactive as it is Static in nature while JSP can interact without the help of CSS & JS even then we can use CSS & JS with JSP pages to make them more elegant and user friendly.
JSP have access to the entire family of Java APIs, including the JDBC API to access enterprise databases while HTML is very limited in this case.
In JSP, we can use a lot of tags such as action tags, jstl, custom tags etc. that reduces the code. Moreover, we can use EL, implicit objects etc. All this functionality is missing in HTML.
A JSP page consists of HTML tags and JSP tags while HTML can only have html tags.
A JSP page can generate & contain dynamic information while regular HTML cannot.
JSP tags can be used for a variety of purposes, such as retrieving information from a database or registering user preferences, accessing JavaBeans components, passing control between pages and sharing information between requests, pages etc… while HTML needs a server side component to perform all these tasks.
JSP is an integral part of Java EE, a complete platform for enterprise class applications. This means that JSP can play a part in the simplest applications to the most complex and demanding while HTML doesn’t even come close to this. I should affirm that 

vaScript is the world's most popular programming language.

JavaScript is the programming language of the Web.
